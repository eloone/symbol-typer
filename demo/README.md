#DEMO PAGES

The demo pages for the symbolTyper library were generated with [Assemble](http://assemble.io/). 
Assemble is very efficient to generate a quick modular static site. I prefer it to Jekyll since it's a nodejs environment - it means you can use Grunt and the watch task (it changes my life !!). It is very suitable for the lazy type who hates copy pasting, especially when it is HTML.

 Assemble's documentation is still a work in progress for some parts and their examples are super messy, you don't know where to start. But you can review the structure of the demo pages here to get a grip on how Assemble works, start by Grunfile.js. Once you get it, I highly recommend it, you can literally create your static website within 1 or 2h.
