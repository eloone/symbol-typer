#DEMO PAGES

The demo pages for the symbolTyper library were generated with [Assemble](http://assemble.io/). 
Assemble is very efficient to generate a quick modular static site. I prefer it to Jekyll since it's a nodejs environment so you can use Grunt and the watch task (it changes my life). It is very suitable for the lazy type who hates copy pasting especially when it is HTML.

You can review the structure of those pages here to get a quick grip on how Assemble works, I highly recommend it, you can literally create you static website within 1H.
