#DEMO PAGES

The demo pages for the symbolTyper library were generated with [Assemble](http://assemble.io/). 
Assemble is very efficient to generate a quick modular static site. I prefer it to Jekyll since it's a nodejs environment.
You can review the structure of those pages here to get a quick grip on how Assemble works, you can literally create you static website within minutes.
